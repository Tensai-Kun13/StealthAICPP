# StealthAICPP
A prototype stealth based game based on Metal Gear Solid VR Missions

This prototype was created for a school class using Unreal Engine 4.22.

I mostly coded this project in C++, however, certain aspeects I have yet to learn to do in C++ such as UI widget functionality.
The AI was coded in C++ and set up in Unreal through a behavior tree.
